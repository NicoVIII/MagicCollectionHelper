# MagicCollectionHelper

This is (for now) a small tool which helps analysing MTG collections exported as CSV
from the brilliant website <https://deckstats.net>.

To run it you can download it from the release page (there is always a release with the latest code)
and execute it.
Your exported data from deckstats has to be placed inside of the same directory as the executable is.
It is typically called something like `collection_000000_0000_0000000000.csv`.

When starting the program and importing your collection, the program will take the newest csv inside
of the folder of the executable.

You can adjust your preferences in the preferences tab of the application. Preferences and imported
collections are not saved for now, the program is readonly. You have to import and adjust preferences
after every start.

For now this project is very experimental. But maybe if I have the time and motivation I will
further work on this and make it easier to use and more powerful.
