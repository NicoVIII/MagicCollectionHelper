# MagicCollectionHelper

This is (for now) a small command line tool which helps analysing MTG collections exported as CSV
from the brilliant website <https://deckstats.net>.

To run it you can download it from the release page (there is always a release with the latest code)
and execute `MagicCollectionHelper <filepath>` / `MagicCollectionHelper.exe <filepath>`
where `<filepath>` is the path to your exported collection. It is typically called something
like `collection_000000_0000_0000000000.csv`.

For now this is very experimental, there is no documentation, nice interface or anything. But maybe
if I have the time and motivation I will further work on this and make it easier to use and more
powerful.
